## WINE-QUALITY-ANALYSIS üç∑
The objective of this project is to predict the quality of wine (White and Red) using various attributes such as acidity, residual sugar, pH, sulphur dioxide, density, alcohol, etc. The model is trained using Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier(RFC) and SVC  algorithms which gives an accuracy of 93%.

The dataset was taken from Kaggle
## JUSTIFICATION üìù
#### ADVANTAGES OF LOGISTIC REGRESSION

It is very efficient, does not require too many computational resources, it‚Äôs highly interpretable, it doesn‚Äôt require input features to be scaled, it doesn‚Äôt require any tuning, it‚Äôs easy to regularize, and it outputs well-calibrated predicted probabilities.

Logistic regression does work better when you remove attributes that are unrelated to the output variable as well as attributes that are very similar (correlated) to each other.

Logistic Regression is easy to implement and very efficient to train.
